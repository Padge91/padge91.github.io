Regex is kind of a monster. It's appears daunting if you're not "in the know" with what it does, or even its purpose. I remember the first time I saw a merge conflict in Git (self learning for school project), and how I felt overwhelmed at the apparent junk that was dumped into my files. Even today, Regex makes me feel very much like that day.

What makes it worse is it's literally impossible to learn by looking at context clues. You can tell what the *goal* of a regex statement is through some kind of comments or context clues, but the *how* can nly be discovered through dedicated learning. I think this is what makes it so intimidating; the only way to learn it is to study.

I'm writing this doc to try and help myself remember some regex concepts I keep returning to. While I could google all of this, it's much easier to come back here to see the highlights.

# Concepts

**Pattern:** A series of characters which define the string we will search for within the larger string.
**Match:** A found result when applying the pattern against the input string.

# Basic Patterns

**Periods:** Periods match any character.
**Asterisks:** The * character matches against any number of whatever follows it.
