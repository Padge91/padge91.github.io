# Free? Yes!
Getting free stock photos to use for a PoC or placeholder site can be a little challenging. Most platforms require an account and some $$$ to be able to show their content, but I found one which can provide high-res, royalty-free photos as long as you make an attribution to the photographer.

# Pexels
https://www.pexels.com is, honestly, wonderful. I don't care about attribution, I just want it to be free. They're pretty open and honest they want the same thing, so it seems everyone can stay happy.

The best thing is they have an API which makes it possibly to dynamically and automatically search and download stock photos, along with the attributor names, based on a search term.

# API for Royalty-Free Stock Photos

Their API documentation to search for photos based on a term (https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/#photos-search) is unbelievably free. It provides multiple URLs to download the image in a number of resolutions and orientations, the potographer name (for attribution) and even a suggested color to pair with it (for skeleton page colors, presumably). 

# Conclusion
Pexels is a fantastic resource to use for quick prototyping of either user-uploaded images or some stock photos for a site. I will definitely return to it in the future for any system-provided defaults.
